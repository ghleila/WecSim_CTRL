function X = flat(x)
% Gives an explicit enumeration of the set of points in the cross product of n grids
%   X = FLAT(x)
% Parameters:
%   x       - cell array of grids
% Returns:
%   X       - flat representation of the grid elements. Each grid element is explicitly stored
%       on a column of X. X has dimension n x N where n is the number of dimensions and N the
%       total number of points on the grids.

% quick return when there is nothing to flatten
