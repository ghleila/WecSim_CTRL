function [ind, mu, indp] = mdegs_p(x, c, roll, n, p, tab)
%  Computes the membership degrees in a P-dimensional conjunction of triangular membership functions.
%   [IND, MU, INDP] = MDEGS_P(X, C, ROLL, N, P, TAB)
%
%  Computes membership degrees for a P-dimensional variable in a p-dimensional conjunction of
%  triangular membership functions. Each P-dimensional fuzzy set is a conjunction (with the
%  product rule) of triangular single-dimensional (1D) fuzzy sets. These 1D sets are normal and
%  the support of each fuzzy set is the interval defined by the centers of the two adjacent
%  fuzzy sets, such that the sum of membership degrees is always one. Each such collection of 1D
%  fuzzy sets is completely determined by the array of centers.
%
%  The computation of the membership degree is optimized, such that the complexity is O(P) where
%  P is the number of dimensions, and the built-in Matlab operations are not considered.
%
%  Parameters:
%   X           - the variable value, a P-dimensional vector (column or row)
%   C           - the centers of the fuzzy sets. A P-element cell array, with each element
%       C{i} a row vector containing the triangle centers across dimension i.
%       The elements of the vector must be unique and sorted in ascending order.
%   ROLL        - rollover flags for the membership functions. Currently not used, reserved.
%   N           - the numbers of fuzzy sets, N{i} = length(C{i})
%   P           - the dimension of the variable, P = length(X) = length(C) = length(N)
%   TAB         - helper variable, should contain DEC2BASE(0:2^p-1, 2) - 47
%   
%  Returns:
%   IND         - the linear indices of the activated p-dimensional membership degrees. A column
%       vector of length 2^P. The activated membership degrees are usually the nonzero membership
%       degrees. For ease of use and implementation, however, some zero membership degrees will
%       be regarded as activated to keep the length of ind constant.
%   MU          - the column vector of activated membership degrees (some of these may be zero). The
%       membership degrees in MU correspond 1-to-1 with the indices in IND.
%   INDP        - the P-dimensional indices of the activated p-dimensional membership degrees.
%       A matrix of dimension 2^P x P, with one P-dimensional index on each row. The rows of
%       INDP correspond 1-to-1 with the membership degrees in MU and the linear indices in IND.
